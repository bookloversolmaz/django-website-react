# Professional website

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a professional website. I have decided to create a website to host some of my software projects and some of my writing.

## Tech stack
The backend (server side) is created in Python, using the Django framework.
The frontend (client side) is created in JavaScript using the React library.
This website uses a SQL database in the form of PostgreSQL.

## Requirements
As this is a web application, the user will not be required to download any specific software etc. However, I intend to add a feature where a user can only access a part of the webiste if they have the correct password.

## What the program does
A professional displaying my software development and other professional skills. I plan on also adding blogs, such as my career change into software from publishing, some of the things I have learned during my journey and perhaps some basics on computer and software.
