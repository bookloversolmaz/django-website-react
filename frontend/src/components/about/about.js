// I am a motivated and determined software developer who has recently graduated from Makers Academy. Prior to 
// Makers I worked as an editor 
// for six years across a range of subject areas where I honed my attention to detail, ability work to a 
// deadline and manage complex projects. I decided to make the change into tech as there is always something 
// to learn and I enjoy challenging myself.
// I have experience working with the programming languages Ruby, JavaScript, Python and C. 
// I have familiar with the fundamentals of software development including object-oriented languages, 
// test-driven development, full stack development and GitHub. I have also completed edX’s CS50’s introduction to computer science.
